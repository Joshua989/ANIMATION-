  
1. **Container Styles:**
   - The `.container` class is used to style the container element, which is set to a flex display. This arrangement centers the button both vertically and horizontally on the page. The `height: 100vh;` ensures that the container takes up the full height of the viewport.

2. **Button Base Styles (`.interactive-button`):**
   - `background-color: #3498db;`: Sets the default background color of the button to a shade of blue (#3498db).
   - `color: white;`: Sets the text color to white.
   - `font-size: 18px;`: Sets the font size of the button text to 18 pixels.
   - `padding: 10px 20px;`: Adds 10 pixels of padding on the top and bottom, and 20 pixels of padding on the left and right of the button text.
   - `border: none;`: Removes the border around the button.
   - `border-radius: 5px;`: Adds a border-radius of 5 pixels, giving the button rounded corners.
   - `cursor: pointer;`: Changes the cursor to a pointer when hovering over the button, indicating it is clickable.
   - `transition: background-color 0.3s, transform 0.3s;`: Applies a smooth transition effect of 0.3 seconds to the `background-color` and `transform` properties. This ensures that color changes and transformations are animated smoothly over the specified duration.

3. **Button Hover Styles (`.interactive-button:hover`):**
   - `background-color: #2980b9;`: Changes the background color to a darker shade of blue (#2980b9) when the button is hovered over.
   - `transform: scale(1.1);`: Scales up the button by 10% (110% of its original size) when hovered, creating a subtle zoom effect.
   - `animation: moveRight 0.5s ease-in-out forwards;`: Applies the `moveRight` animation defined using keyframes. The animation lasts for 0.5 seconds, has an ease-in-out timing function for a smooth start and end, and moves the button 50 pixels to the right. The `forwards` value ensures that the button retains its final position after the animation completes.

4. **Keyframes Animation (`@keyframes moveRight`):**
   - `0%`: Represents the starting point of the animation where the button has no horizontal translation (`transform: translateX(0);`).
   - `100%`: Represents the ending point of the animation where the button is translated 50 pixels to the right (`transform: translateX(50px);`).

In summary, these CSS styles define the button's appearance, behavior on hover, and a chained animation effect. When the button is hovered over, it smoothly changes color, scales up, and moves to the right, providing an interactive and visually appealing user experience.
